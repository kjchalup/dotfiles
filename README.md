My Linux config files, for syncing my Linux config across multiple machines. Feel free to use anything you find here.

I work on Arch Linux using the Awesome Window Manager and Vim. 
I currently use the <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim">Base16</a> color scheme for Vim and urxvt, so Xresources are configured for that.
