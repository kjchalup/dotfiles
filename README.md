My Linux config files, for syncing across multiple machines. Feel free to use anything you find here.

I work on <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> using the <a href="https://awesomewm.org/">Awesome Window Manager</a> and <a href="www.vim.org">Vim</a>. I picked <a href="https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats">copycat-killer</a> Awesome WM themes, I use one of them. For Vim and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/rxvt-unicode">urxvt-unicode</a> (a great terminal emulator) I use the <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim">Base16</a> color scheme for Vim and urxvt, so Xresources is configured for that. 

Since Vim 8, Vim provides <a href="https://dvonrohr.com/2016/12/11/vim-package-manager/">native package management</a> that integrates well with github. Hence, the vim/ directory contains git submodules with Vim packages I installed.

Altogether this config looks like this (and is extremely keyboard-use friendly):
